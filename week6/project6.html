    <h>What is the purpose of a function?</h>
    <p>Functions allow code to be repeatedly called with short lines 
    so code doesn't need to be rewritten every time it's used.</p>
    <p>Testing code, F12 isn't needed for this one.</p>

        let username = prompt("Enter your name:");
        let firstGas = parseFloat(prompt("Please enter your weekly gas totals."
            + " Enter - 1 when done."));
        let gas = calcGasAvg();
        confirm(`${username}\'s average weekly gas bill is ${gas.toFixed(2)}`);
